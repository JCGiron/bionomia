    %p June 15, 2020

    %p Friends,

    %p
      I must rebrand Bloodhound Tracker including a new domain name. I stumbled across a paper in June 2020 and I ask that you please set aside about hour or more to read it:

    %p
      Parry, T.D., and C.W. Yingling. 2020. Slave Hounds and Abolition in the Americas.
      %em Past & Present
      246: 69–108.
      %a{href:"https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtz020"} https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtz020

    %p{class:"clearfix"}
      %img{src:"/images/bloodhound_logo.png", alt:"Bloodhound Tracker", class:"float-left mr-3"}
      I am horrified by the events in that paper and I am ashamed of my naivety. Bloodhound as a brand and its logo are inexcusable. Natural history museums of the world have
      %a{href:"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/july/are-natural-history-museums-inherently-racist.html"} acknowledged their role
      in colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade. I reject any whitewashing of this past. All Black and Indigenous People of Colour must feel comfortable and empowered to be here, to participate, to learn, and to lead.

    %p
      All links from Bloodhound Tracker redirect to Bionomia. On December 1, 2020, the Bloodhound Tracker site will be entirely eliminated, which ought to provide sufficient time for search indices and sites to update links and to use the new logo.

  %em Bionomia
  is an unusual, exotic word. It is occasionally used by Spanish-speaking biologists and translates to
  %em bionomy
  \– the laws of life – encompassing distribution and ecology. Its first use could have been in the Lancet in 1848,
  %a{href: "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360272610X"} "Bionomia; Or, the Law of Life"
  wherein ΦΙΛΑΛΗΘΗΣ describes their newly coined term as an interplay between the potential energy of
  %em excitability
  and a physical manifestation as
  %em excitants.
  But, the author also evokes a subtle mysticism beyond a pedestrian, balancing of equations. Let's also define
  %em Bionomia
  as reverence, wonder, agency, refinement, passage, and the energetics of connections. These are all good words to describe the manner of a natural historian.  The logo is a stylized quill, caught in the act of signing its autograph on a signature plant leaf.
